  summary: "The hacker who stole over $300M from Coinbase users is back on-chain, accumulating ETH after dumping millions earlier.",
  insight:
    "Blockchain analysts have identified renewed activity from the hacker responsible for stealing more than $300 million from Coinbase users in a sophisticated exploit. After previously offloading 26,762 ETH (worth ~$69.25M at the time) at a price of $2,588, the hacker has now accumulated over 5,512 ETH (~$14.86M), including a recent purchase of 4,863 ETH for $12.55M at $2,581 and another 649.62 ETH for $2.31M at $3,561.\n\nExperts note the hacker's on-chain behavior reflects advanced knowledge of market cycles and wallet obfuscation techniques, using multiple addresses and timing buys around major ETH movements. The funds from the original hack remain partially traceable, with laundering attempts ongoing via mixers and DeFi protocols. The activity has raised concerns about the potential use of these assets for market manipulation or further cyber exploits.",
